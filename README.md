# DBDAA: Dual Blockchain and Decentralized Identifiers Assisted Anonymous Authentication for Building IoT

This repository contains the code implementation for the paper titled "**DBDAA: Dual Blockchain and Decentralized Identifiers Assisted Anonymous Authentication for Building IoT**." This project utilizes a dual blockchain architecture, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), and cryptographic methods to enable anonymous authentication in IoT environments.
